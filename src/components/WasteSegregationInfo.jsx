      <h2>The Problem of Waste Segregation in India</h2>
      <p>
        India generates about **62 million tons of waste annually**, and a significant
        portion of it remains untreated due to improper segregation at the source.
        The lack of awareness and infrastructure for proper waste segregation leads
        to contamination of recyclable materials and hazardous effects on the environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Segregation of wet and dry waste is critical to ensure effective recycling,
        reduce landfill overflow, and minimize the harmful impact on health and nature.
      </p>
